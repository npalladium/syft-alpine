# Syft Alpine

A Docker image for [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) with Shell. Refer this [issue](https://github.com/anchore/syft/issues/833).

[![unstable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/unstable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

The build is quite hacky and this image is just a temporary measure.
